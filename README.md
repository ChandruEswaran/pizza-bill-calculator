# Pizza Bill Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the total cost of a pizza order.  
You can choose the pizza size (small, medium, large), add pepper, and extra cheese.  
The program then calculates and displays the final bill amount.

## How to use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the pizza size when prompted (`s`, `m`, or `l`).
3. Choose whether to add pepper (`y` or `n`).
4. Choose whether to add extra cheese (`y` or `n`).
5. The total bill will be displayed.

## Example
- Enter the size of the pizza (s, m, l): m
- Do you want to add pepper (y/n)? n
- Do you want to add extra cheese (y/n)? y
- ## The total bill is: $21
